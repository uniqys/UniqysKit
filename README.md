**WARNING:** Uniqys Kit is still in beta version, and we may still make some breaking changes.

Uniqys Kit is a framework for building Decentralized Applications (or DApps).
It is designed for web developers to easily build DApps; just like you always build your web app.

For details, visit our [project website](https://uniqys.net/kit) and [documentation](https://uniqys.github.io/UniqysKitDocs/).

Also, feedbacks are appreciated via GitHub issues, [Gitter](https://gitter.im/uniqys/UniqysKit), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uniqys).

## Introduction

Uniqys Kit has two main components:

- Chain Core: Builds and manages a blockchain on a Tendermint consensus algorithm.
- Easy Framework: A framework for developers to create DApps without being aware of the blockchain.

These two packages were designed to remove some of the current obstacles in creating or using DApps.

### TL;DR

- Chain Core establishes an application-friendly blockchain network.
  - **Scalable:** Creates a single blockchain for every single DApp.
  - **Fast:** Instant finality and high transaction throughput are obtained with the Tendermint alogorithm.
  - **Flexible:** Developers can decide the most suitable transaction fees and incentives to the network maintainer.
- Easy Framework achieves "DApp development â‰’ Web app development".
  - Building a REST API and a frontend is all you need to do to develop a DApp.
  - No programming language restriction.
  - Data storing on blockchain can be done with using a pre-existing Memcached library.
  - Sending a transaction is sending a signed HTTP request.
- Track external events (i.e. Ethereum Events) in the blockchain network so that it can become a side chain.
